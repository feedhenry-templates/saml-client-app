---------
Author: Erik Jan de Wit   
Level: Intermediate   
Technologies: Javascript, Cordova, RHMAP   
Summary: A demonstration of how to synchronize a single collection with RHMAP.   
Community Project: [Feed Henry](http://feedhenry.org)   
Target Product: RHMAP   
Product Versions: RHMAP 3.8.0+   
Source: https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/sync-cordova-app   
Prerequisites: fh-js-sdk : 2.14.+, cordova 5.0+   

## What is it?

This application shows how you can use SAML with the RHMAP platform, it should be used in combination with the [SAML service](https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/saml-service) and the [SAML could app](https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/saml-cloud-app) have a look at the [notes](https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/saml-service/blob/master/NOTES.md) how to setup the service.  Refer to `www/fhconfig.json` for configuration.

If you do not have access to a RHMAP instance, you can sign up for a free instance at [https://openshift.feedhenry.com/](https://openshift.feedhenry.com/).

## How do I run it?  

### RHMAP Studio

This application and its cloud services are available as a project template in RHMAP as part of the "SAML Example Project" template.

### Local Clone (ideal for Open Source Development)
If you wish to contribute to this template, the following information may be helpful; otherwise, RHMAP and its build facilities are the preferred solution.

###  Prerequisites  
 * fh-js-sdk : 2.14.+
 * cordova: 5.0+

## Build instructions
 * npm install
 * Edit `www/fhconfig.json` to include the relevant information from RHMAP.  
 * Edit `config.xml` to add an access tag for the SAML_ENTRY_POINT from RHMAP.
 * cordova serve  

### npm dependencies
The `fh-js-sdk` and other development dependencies are defined in `package.json` and included in a `www/main.js`.

* This generated `www/main.js` file is checked-in to allow RHMAP studio preview to statically serve dependencies.

* The `www/js/init.js` file is browserified and acts as a bridge between template script and npm dependencies. 

* All the other JavaScript files in the template app will not be browserified, in order for you to be able to experiment live edit in RHMAP Studio preview.

### Updating fh-js-sdk version
To update the JS SDK:
- change the version in `package.json`
- run `npm install` a grunt task is automatically ran to regenerate main.js
- check-in git repo the npackage.json + main.js

## How does it work?

Click the "Sign In" button to sign in via your configured SAML IdP, this will open a webbrowser that you can use to login
